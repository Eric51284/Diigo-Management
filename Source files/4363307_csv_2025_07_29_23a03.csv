This is because chemical reactions cause it to be removed from the atmosphere, with a half life of about a decade""","","Highlight:This masks the fact that 1 GtCH4 has a strong warming influence when it is first emitted, which then diminishes rapidly over a few decades. This is because chemical reactions cause it to be removed from the atmosphere, with a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">half life</a> of about a decade
Highlight:Ambitious mitigation scenarios could, therefore, give the impression of giving rise to warming instead of cooling from methane, if expressed using GWP100.
Highlight:By using GWP*, emissions of methane expressed as CO2e relate much more closely to temperature response. This can be seen in the figure below. The top panels use GWP100, while the lower panels use GWP*. The left panels show annual emissions of CO2e (upper left) and CO2e* (lower left). In the right panels, temperature is shown in the dashed lines alongside the cumulative CO2e/CO2e* emissions in the solid lines.

"Grassland Carbon Management | Climate Change Resource Center","https://www.fs.usda.gov/ccrc/topics/grassland-carbon-management","no_tag","","","Highlight:Grasslands cover approximately 25% of the Earth’s land surface (approximately 3.4 billion ha) and contain roughly 12% of the terrestrial carbon stocks (1,2)
Highlight:Grasslands are used intensively for food and forage production globally because of their high natural soil fertility. Carbon stores within grasslands are sensitive to management and are thus vulnerable to losses in soil carbon
Highlight:grazing impacts on soil carbon can depend on interactions between soils, plant species, and climate. On sites with higher rainfall, grazing generally increases soil carbon on sandy, coarse-textured soils, while clay soils respond with weak increases to strong decreases in soil carbon. For arid grasslands, the opposite seems true: fine-textured clay soils show the largest increase in soil carbon to grazing relative to sandy soils (12). These patterns in response to proper grazing management suggest a general trend towards increases in soil carbon, which a global analysis estimates as an increase in carbon stocks averaging 2.9% (13). Greater water-holding capacity of clay soils may increase this benefit in arid systems (14), while compaction of clay soils may restrict roots and actually reduce soil carbon over time in wet systems where soil moisture is not limiting (15).
Highlight:The recovery of soil carbon is typically a slow process, taking many decades to centuries, depending on the carbon balance of the system (4). Despite these slow changes, the global potential for carbon sequestration from restoring degraded grasslands is significant, with the possibility to sequester approximately 3 Gt C per year—equivalent to reducing atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> by 50 ppm over 50 years (19). In addition to restoring degraded grasslands to improve carbon storage, grassland management strategies should recognize the critical goal of maintaining grassland cover and preventing degradation to conserve the ability of that land to continue sequestering carbon.&nbsp;

"Chapter 5 : Food Security — Special Report on Climate Change and Land","https://www.ipcc.ch/srccl/chapter/chapter-5/","no_tag","""About 21–37% of total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are attributable to the food system. These are from agriculture and land use, storage, transport, packaging, processing, retail, and consumption (medium confidence). This estimate includes emissions of 9–14% from crop and livestock activities within the farm gate and 5–14% from land use and land-use change including deforestation and peatland degradation (high confidence); 5–10% is from supply chain activities (medium confidence). This estimate includes GHG emissions from food loss and waste. Within the food system, during the period 2007–2016, the major sources of emissions from the supply side were agricultural production, with crop and livestock activities within the farm gate generating respectively 142 ± 42 TgCH4 yr–1 (high confidence) and 8.0 ± 2.5 TgN2O yr–1 (high confidence), and CO2 emissions linked to relevant land-use change dynamics such as deforestation and peatland degradation, generating 4.9 ± 2.5 GtCO2 yr-1. Using 100-year GWP values (no climate feedback) from the IPCC AR5, this implies that total GHG emissions from agriculture were 6.2 ± 1.4 GtCO2-eq yr-1, increasing to 11.1 ± 2.9 GtCO2-eq yr–1 including relevant land use. Without intervention, these are likely to increase by about 30–40% by 2050, due to increasing demand based on population and income growth and dietary change (high confidence). {5.4}""","","Highlight:<strong>About 21–37% of total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are attributable to the food system.</strong> These are from agriculture and land use, storage, transport, packaging, processing, retail, and consumption (<em>medium confidence</em>).

"The Tragedy of the Commons: How Elinor Ostrom Solved One of Life's Greatest Dilemmas - Evonomics","https://evonomics.com/tragedy-of-the-commons-elinor-ostrom/","no_tag","","","Highlight:The social sciences were dominated by a position known as methodological individualism, which treated all social phenomena as reducible to individual-level phenomena, as if groups were not legitimate units of analysis in their own right (Campbell 1990).
Highlight:<em>groups are capable of avoiding the tragedy of the commons without requiring top-down regulation</em>, at least if certain conditions are met
Highlight:Multilevel selection theory, which envisions natural selection operating on a multi-tier hierarchy of units,
Highlight:whereby members of groups become so cooperative that the group becomes a higher-level organism in its own right
Highlight:irst proposed by cell biologist Lynn Margulis (1970) to explain how nucleated cells evolved from symbiotic associations of bacteria. It was then generalized during the 1990s to explain other major transitions, such as the rise of the first bacterial cells, multicellular organisms, eusocial insect colonies and human evolution (Maynard Smith and Szathmary 1995, 1999).
Highlight:With disruptive competition within groups held largely in check, succeeding as a group became the main selective force in human evolution.
Highlight:Clearly defined boundaries (DP1) meant that members knew they were part of a group and what the group was about (e.g., fisherman with access to a bay or farmers managing an irrigation system). Proportional equivalence of costs and benefits (DP2) meant that members had to earn their benefits and couldn’t just appropriate them. Collective choice arrangements (DP3) meant that group members had to agree upon decisions so nobody could be bossed around. Monitoring (DP4) and graduated sanctions (DP5) meant that disruptive self-serving behaviors could be detected and punished. Fast and fair conflict resolution (DP6) meant that the group would not be torn apart by internal conflicts of interest. Local autonomy (DP7) meant that the group had the elbow room to manage its own affairs. Appropriate relations with other tiers of rule making authority (DP8) meant that everything regulating the conduct of individuals within a given group also was needed to regulate conduct among groups in a multi group population.

"Are Ionophores a Risk for Antimicrobial Resistance? | BeefResearch.ca","http://www.beefresearch.ca/blog/ionophores-risk-for-amr-bergen/","no_tag","","","Highlight:Ionophores also seem to be virtually immune to co-resistance.
Highlight:ne experiment showed that bacteria developed resistance to bacitracin when ionophores were used. Those researchers suspected the bacitracin resistance was related to the same protein-carbohydrate armor described above. Bacitracin is not licensed for use in beef cattle, but it is an ingredient in Polysporin,
Highlight:This probably explains why ionophores are still effective after being heavily used in beef production for at least 35 years. Health Canada’s decision to allow ionophores to retain their label claims for growth and feed efficiency was grounded in sound science.

Sticky notes:Straw man
Highlight:places an obligation upon them to be able to substantiate it.
Sticky notes:I disagree -- the burden of proof is on those who would argue that there is some other way that such knowledge could have been gained
Highlight:various ways of quantifying evidential weight, of which the most direct and transparent is the so-called likelihood ratio (LR), whose definition is such that only tests producing LR &gt;1 can be deemed to have contributed any weight of evidence
Highlight:For example, the largest review of the predictive performance of animal toxicity studies covers 150 drugs specifically associated with adverse events or toxicity in humans in testing by pharmaceutical companies.<sup><a href=""#ref16"" rid=""ref16"" class="" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip"" id=""__tag_311695917"" role=""button"" aria-expanded=""false"" aria-haspopup=""true"">16</a></sup>
Highlight:All animal models possess both sensitivity and specificity values, and thus lead to values for the evidential weight provided by each such model. As such, they provide the quantitative underpinning for statements about the value of animal models to medical progress
Sticky notes:This logic seems to depend on thinking about results from such studies as dichotomous (either the ultimate treatment did, or did not work). What about the underlying knowledge that is gained toward developing future solutions?
Highlight:When calculated correctly (see Appendix), the LRs of the animal models examined by Schein <em>et al</em>.<sup><a href=""#ref11"" rid=""ref11"" class="" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip"" id=""__tag_145462390"" role=""button"" aria-expanded=""false"" aria-haspopup=""true"">11</a></sup> have 95% confidence intervals that fail to exclude unity for all ten of the organ system toxicities considered. In other words, the data provide no statistically credible evidence that these animal models contribute any predictive value, either separately or in combination.
Highlight:the wholly unexceptionable claim that experiments on animals have made ‘an important contribution’ to advances in medicine and surgery

Highlight:shortcomings of the clinical trials.
Highlight:failed to acknowledge the limitations of efficacy observed in animal studies
Sticky notes:The first linked article talks about failure of clinical studies to adequately follow design of animal studies.
Highlight:third possible explanation is the lack of external validity, or generalisability, of some animal models; in other words, that these do not sufficiently reflect disease in humans
Highlight:methodologically flawed animal studies.
Highlight:aims to address the possible sources of bias that threaten the internal and external validity of animal studies, to provide solutions to improve the reliability of such studies, and thereby to improve their translation to the clinic.
Highlight:the impact of study quality has been studied much more extensively in clinical trials than in animal studies
Highlight:The presence of bias in animal studies has been tested most extensively in studies of acute ischemic stroke, probably because in this field the gap between the laboratory and the clinic is both very large and well recognised
Highlight:Several systematic reviews and meta-analyses have provided empirical evidence that inadequate methodological approaches in controlled clinical trials are associated with bias. Clinical trials in which authors did not report randomisation, adequately conceal treatment allocation, or use double blinding yielded larger estimates of treatment effects than trials in which these study quality issues were reported
Highlight:translation of its results to the clinic may fail because of disparities between the model and the clinical trials testing the treatment strategy
Highlight:Whereas the issues for internal validity probably apply to the majority of animal models regardless of the disease under study, the external validity of a model will largely be determined by disease-specific factors.
Highlight:As mentioned above, the translation of efficacy from animal studies to human disease has perhaps been least successful for neurological diseases in general and for ischaemic stroke in particular.
Highlight:no other animal model of disease that has been more rigorously subjected to systematic review and meta-analysis,
Highlight:animals that are perhaps biologically closer to humans are hardly ever used
Highlight:failed to acknowledge the inevitable delay between the onset of symptoms and the possibility to start treatment in patients.
Highlight:For these reasons, it is not surprising that, except for thrombolysis, all treatment strategies proven effective in the laboratory have failed in the clinic.
Highlight:Given that a framework regulating animal experimentation already exists in many countries, we suggest that this might be exploited to allow the maintenance of a central register of experiments performed, and registration referenced in publications.

"Christianity and Animal Rights: The Challenge and Promise – Religion Online","https://www.religion-online.org/article/christianity-and-animal-rights-the-challenge-and-promise/","no_tag","","","Highlight:I shall make bold and hazard the opinion that there is no one, unambiguous, unwavering biblical answer to either question
Highlight:Many passages lend support to viewing all of nonhuman creation as having no or little value apart from human needs and interests, a reading that tends naturally to support the view that human moral agents act wrongfully with regard to the nonhuman world only if our treatment of it harms some legitimate human need or interest. This is the traditional Christian anthropocentrism
Highlight:By contrast, other passages support views that are more or less nonanthropocentric. I do not profess to know how to prove that the anthropocentric reading is false or unfounded, or that a lesser or a greater nonanthropocentric reading is true or well-grounded. Indeed, as I already have indicated, I do not myself believe that the Bible offers just one answer to the questions before us
Highlight:With minds so feeble, spirits so weak, and a biblical message so open to honest differences of interpretation among people of real faith and good will, all who take spiritual sustenance from the pages of the Bible ought to realize both the value of, and the need to practice, the virtue of tolerance
Highlight:God<b> </b>is said to find each part of creation ""good"" before humans came upon the scene and that humans were created by God (or came upon the scene) on the same day as the nonhuman animals to which I have been referring
Highlight:But I find in the opening saga of creation an even deeper, more profound message regarding God’s plans in and hopes for creation. For I find in that account the unmistakable message that God did not create nonhuman animals for the use of humans
Highlight:And yet what we find in the opening saga of creation is just the opposite. The food we are given by God is not the flesh of animals, it is ""all plants that bear seed everywhere on the earth, and every tree bearing fruit which yields seed: they shall be yours for food""
Highlight:For what <i>is </i>clear -- clear beyond any doubt, as I read the scriptures -- is that human beings simply do not eat nonhuman animals in that fullness of God’s creation the image of Eden represents. And this is true whether Eden once was (but was shattered), or is yet to be (if, by the grace of God, we will but create it).

"An Introduction to Recursive Partitioning: Rationale, Application and Characteristics of Classification and Regression Trees, Bagging and Random Forests","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2927982/","no_tag","","","Highlight:The main flaw of simple tree models is their instability to small changes in the learning data:
Highlight:As a solution to the problem of instability, the average over an ensembles of trees, rather than a single tree, is used for prediction in ensemble methods
Highlight:ensemble methods have the additional advantage, that their decision boundaries are more smooth than those of single trees
Highlight:The related methods bagging and random forests vary only in the way this set of trees is constructed.
Highlight:In random forests another source of diversity is introduced when the set of predictor variables to select from is randomly restricted in each split, producing even more diverse trees
Highlight:random forests include bagging as the special case where the number of randomly preselected splitting variables is equal to the overall number of variables.
Highlight:In addition to the smoothing of hard decision boundaries, the random selection of splitting variables in random forests allows predictor variables, that were otherwise outplayed by a stronger competitor, to enter the ensemble
Highlight:However, in most real data applications – especially in cases where many predictor variables work in complex interactions – the prediction accuracy of random forests is found to be higher than for bagging, and both ensemble methods usually highly outperform single trees.
Highlight:he “Gini importance”
Highlight:However, in many applications involving predictor variables of different types, this measure is biased, as outlined in section “Bias in variable selection and variable importance”.
Highlight:The most advanced variable importance measure available in random forests is the “permutation accuracy importance” measure
Highlight:usually the out-of-bag prediction accuracy is used to compute the permutation importance) before and after permuting a variable, averaged over all trees.
Highlight:n real data applications, however, the random forest variable importance may reveal higher importance scores for variables working in complex interactions, that may have gone unnoticed in single trees and bagging (as well as in parametric regression models, where modeling high-order interactions is usually not possible at all)
Highlight:To further explore and interpret the effects and interactions of the predictor variables that were found relevant in a random forest, multivariate data visualization tools, such as those described in <a href=""#R30"" rid=""R30"" class="" bibr popnode"" role=""button"" aria-expanded=""false"" aria-haspopup=""true"">Cook and Swayne (2007)</a>, are strongly suggested.
Highlight:n the other hand, the resulting functional shape cannot be interpreted or grasped analytically, and (aside from measures of overall variable importance) can only serve as a “black-box” for prediction. This characteristic of many machine learning approaches has fueled discussions about the legitimacy and usefulness of such complex, nonlinear models (see, e.g., <a href=""#R48"" rid=""R48"" class="" bibr popnode"" role=""button"" aria-expanded=""false"" aria-haspopup=""true"">Hand 2006</a>, and the corresponding discussion).
Highlight:f a linear or other parametric model with a limited number and degree of interaction terms can reach the (cross validated or test sample) prediction accuracy of the more complex model, the extra complexity may be uncalled for and the simpler, interpretable model should be given preference. If, however, the prediction accuracy cannot be reached with the simpler model, and, for example, the high importance of a variable in a random forest is not reflected by its respective parameters in the simpler model, relevant nonlinear or interaction effects may be missing in the simpler model and it may not be suited to grasp the complexity of the underlying process.
Highlight:In addition to this, a “black-box” method like random forests can be used to identify a small number of potentially relevant predictors from the full feature list, that can then be processed, e.g., by means of a familiar parametric method
Highlight:Note, however, that variable selection should not be conducted before applying another statistical method on the same learning data
Highlight:In general, the higher the number of trees the more reliable is the prediction and the interpretability of the variable importance.
Highlight:n general, random forests with random preselection perform better than bagging with no random preselection at all, but small values of mtry do not always prove beneficial:
Highlight:hen predictor variables are highly correlated, the results of <a href=""#R93"" rid=""R93"" class="" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip"" id=""__tag_194418030"" role=""button"" aria-expanded=""false"" aria-haspopup=""true"">Strobl et al. (2008)</a> indicate that a higher number of randomly preselected predictor variables is better suited to reflect conditional importance
Highlight:Note, however, that the choice of tuning parameters in random forests is not as critical as in other computerintensive approaches,
Highlight:f you observe that, for a different random seed, your prediction results and variable importance rankings (for the top-scoring variables) differ notably, you should not interpret the results but adjust the number of trees and preselected predictor variables.
Highlight:n problems with a high number of observations and few variables a better convergence rate (of the mean squared error as a measure of prediction accuracy) can be achieved when the terminal node size increases with the sample size (i.e. when smaller trees are grown for larger samples). On the other hand for problems with small sample sizes or even “small n large p” problems, growing large trees usually does lead to the best performance.
Highlight:Of course other recent statistical learning methods, such as boosting (<a href=""#R41"" rid=""R41"" class="" bibr popnode"" role=""button"" aria-expanded=""false"" aria-haspopup=""true"">Freund and Schapire 1997</a>) and support vector machines (cf. <a href=""#R100"" rid=""R100"" class="" bibr popnode"" role=""button"" aria-expanded=""false"" aria-haspopup=""true"">Vapnik 1995</a>, for an introduction) can also be applied to the scope of problems we suggested for the application of random forests. The performance of these methods is within a close range with that of random forests, so that in some comparison studies random forests clearly outperform their competitors
Highlight:hile in others they are slightly outperforme

"Cosmic Thinker Worries about the Ends of Science and Humanity","https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/cosmic-thinker-worries-about-ends-of-science-and-humanity/","no_tag","","","Highlight:<p><a href=""https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/world-s-smartest-physicist-thinks-science-can-t-crack-consciousness/""><strong>Edward Witten says</strong></a><strong> consciousness might be harder to solve than the origin of the universe. What's your view?</strong></p><p>I’m not sure how to answer this question. It’s possible that both these great challenges will be solved in coming decades (or centuries); or that one will be and the other won’t; or that both will have to await posthuman intelligence for a solution. But it’s important to note that only 1 percent of scientists are physicists who work (like Ed Witten) on the frontiers of the very small or of the very large. 99 percent work on the third frontier: the very complex. And the greatest complexity is found in the biological world:&nbsp; even the simplest living thing has layer upon layer of structure and is perplexingly complicated.</p>
Highlight:Scientists are nearly all reductionists in the sense that they feel confident that everything, however complex, is a solution of Schrodinger’s equation – unlike the “vitalists” of earlier eras, who thought that living things were infused with some special “essence.” But this reductionism isn’t conceptually useful – it doesn’t offer the best explanation.
Highlight:Even a phenomenon as un-mysterious as the flow of water in pipes or rivers is understood in terms of “emergent” concepts like viscosity and turbulence. Specialists in fluid mechanics don’t care that water actually made up of H2O molecules; they envisage it as a continuum. Even if they had a hypercomputer that could solve Schrodinger’s equation for the flow, atom by atom, the resultant simulation wouldn’t provide any insight into how waves break, or what makes a flow go turbulent. And new irreducible concepts are even more crucial to our understanding of really complicated phenomena -- for instance, migrating birds or human brains.&nbsp; Phenomena with different levels of complexity&nbsp;&nbsp; are understood in terms of different irreducible concepts – turbulence, survival, alertness, and so forth. The brain is an assemblage of cells; a painting is an assemblage of chemical pigment. But what’s important and interesting is the pattern and structure – the emergent complexity.
Highlight:The entire structure of a building is imperiled by weak foundations. In contrast, the “higher level” sciences dealing with complex systems aren’t vulnerable to an insecure base, as a building is. Each science has its own distinct concepts and modes of explanation. Reductionism is true in a sense.&nbsp; But it's seldom true in a <em>useful </em>sense. And most of the recent breakthroughs which have rendered the last two decades the most exciting and vibrant period in science have been at these “higher” levels.

that is his whole secret; but is this not the acutest sufferings
for such a man as he, who killed all his young life in asceticism
in the desert, and yet could not cure himself of his love towards
his fellowmen? Toward the end of his life he becomes convinced
that it is only by following the advice of the great and terrible
spirit that the fate of these millions of weak rebels, these
'half-finished samples of humanity created in mockery' can be
made tolerable.  And once convinced of it, he sees as clearly
that to achieve that object, one must follow blindly the guidance
of the wise spirit, the fearful spirit of death and destruction,
hence accept a system of lies and deception and lead humanity
consciously this time toward death and destruction, and moreover,
be deceiving them all the while in order to prevent them from
realizing where they are being led, and so force the miserable
blind men to feel happy, at least while here on earth.

Highlight:In a mixed model, you can consider the data in a conditional and an unconditional sense. If you imagine a particular realization of the random effects, then you are considering the conditional distribution Y|γ. If you are interested in quantities averaged over all possible values of the random effects, then you are interested in Y; this is called the marginal formulation
Highlight:Such update formulas are available in the mixed model only if you assume that the covariance parameters are not affected by the removal of the observation in question. This is rarely a reasonable assumption.
Highlight:Scaled residuals can be useful to diagnose whether the covariance structure of the mixed model has been specified correctly.
Highlight:Internally and externally studentized residuals are excellent statistics for detecting unusual observations
Highlight:Influence diagnostics for the covariance parameters are only available in iterative mode.
Highlight:nfluence diagnostics are requested with the INFLUENCE option of the MODEL statement in PROC MIXED
Highlight:suboptions of the INFLUENCE option control the type of influence analysis, for example, iterative or noniterative, point or set deletion, etc
Highlight:Raw conditional and marginal residuals are computed automatically by the MIXED procedure when the OUTP= or OUTPM= options of the MODEL statement are specified.

Highlight:a funnel graph. When a large number of studies have been done on a single subject, the data should follow a pattern: studies with a large sample size should all cluster around a common value—the true result—whereas those with a smaller sample size should exhibit a random scattering, since they’re subject to greater sampling erro

Highlight:FDA concludes that the use of EPA and DHA omega-3 fatty acids as dietary supplements and as an ingredient in conventional foods is safe and lawful under 21 CFR 101.14, provided that the daily intakes of EPA and DHA omega-3 fatty acids do not exceed 3 grams per person per day from conventional foods and dietary supplement sources.&nbsp;
Highlight:<p>DA concludes that there is sufficient evidence for a qualified health claim, provided that the qualified claim is appropriately worded so as to not mislead consumers.&nbsp; Thus, FDA will consider exercising enforcement discretion for the following qualified health claim:</p><blockquote>Supportive but not conclusive research shows that consumption of EPA and DHA omega-3 fatty acids may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease.&nbsp; One serving of [Name of the food] provides [&nbsp; ] gram of EPA and DHA omega-3 fatty acids.&nbsp; [See nutrition information for total fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol content.]</blockquote>

It is important to note that the statistical models utilized in this study do not differentiate the treatment effect from the effect of time, and consequently the analysis performed provides a measure of multiple potential factors that can contribute to treatment response. These factors may include regression to the mean, investigator bias, client bias, the potential for a higher level of care during the study, and improved adherence to treatment with active medication that is being administered in addition to the placebo during the study.

Highlight:Ultimately, therefore, the way to end the proliferation of bad science is not to nag people to behave better, or even to encourage replication, but for universities and funding agencies to stop rewarding researchers who publish copiously over those who publish fewer, but perhaps higher-quality papers.
Highlight:To this end, they built an evolutionary computer model in which 100 laboratories competed for “pay-offs” representing prestige or funding that result from publications. ... Labs that garnered more pay-offs were more likely to pass on their methods to other, newer labs (their “progeny”

This term can result in standard error shrinkage. Also, the resulting adjusted covariance matrix can then be indefinite and is not invariant under reparameterization. The first-order Kenward-Roger covariance matrix adjustment eliminates the second derivatives from the calculation. All spatial structures and the AR(1) structure are covariance structures that generally lead to nonzero second derivatives.

"Multiple comparisons - Handbook of Biological Statistics","http://www.biostathandbook.com/multiplecomparisons.html","no_tag","","","Highlight:Sometimes you will see a ""Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted <em>P</em> value."" The adjusted <em>P</em> value for a test is either the raw <em>P</em> value times <em>m/i</em> or the adjusted <em>P</em> value for the next higher raw <em>P</em> value, whichever is smaller (remember that <em>m</em> is the number of tests and <em>i</em> is the rank of each test, with 1 the rank of the smallest <em>P</em> value).
Highlight:f the adjusted <em>P</em> value is smaller than the false discovery rate, the test is significant.
Highlight:In my opinion ""adjusted <em>P</em> values"" are a little confusing, since they're not really estimates of the probability (<em>P</em>) of anything. I think it's better to give the raw <em>P</em> values and say which are significant using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure with your false discovery rate, but if Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted <em>P</em> values are common in the literature of your field, you might have to use them.
Highlight:The Bonferroni correction and Benjamini-Hochberg procedure assume that the individual tests are independent of each other,
Highlight:One place this occurs is when you're doing <a href=""http://www.biostathandbook.com/anovaunplanned.html"">unplanned comparisons of means</a> in anova, for which a variety of other techniques have been developed, such as the Tukey-Kramer test
Highlight:other experimental design with multiple, non-independent comparisons is when you compare multiple variables between groups, and the variables are correlated with each other within groups. An example would be knocking out your favorite gene in mice and comparing everything you can think of on knockout vs. control mice: length, weight, strength, running speed, food consumption, feces production, etc. All of these variables are likely to be correlated within groups; mice that are longer will probably also weigh more, would be stronger, run faster, eat more food, and poop more. To analyze this kind of experiment, you can use multivariate analysis of variance, or manova, which I'm not covering in this textbook.
Highlight:ther, more complicated techniques, such as Reiner et al. (2003), have been developed for controlling false discovery rate that may be more appropriate when there is lack of independence in the data. If you're using microarrays, in particular, you need to become familiar with this topic.

Highlight:we can learn to constantly remind ourselves that no matter how right we feel, there is a possibility that we might be wrong.

How large would the P value be if the assumption of compound symmetry were grossly violated? A method called the <em>lower-bound adjustment</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;computes this. Compute the P value for the same F ratio, but reduce the degrees of freedom to 1 for the numerator, and n-1 for the denominator (where n is the number of subjects). For this example, we can find the P value using this Excel formula:&nbsp;=FDIST(15.76,1,4). This adjusted (<em>lower bound</em>) P value is 0.0165.&nbsp;

"Beyond Critical Thinking - The Chronicle Review - The Chronicle of Higher Education","http://chronicle.com/article/Beyond-Critical-Thinking/63288","""critical thinking"",education","","","Highlight:A common way to show that one has sharpened one's critical thinking is to display an ability to see through or undermine statements made by (or beliefs held by) others.
Highlight:Ennis was interested in how we teach the ""correct assessment of statements
Highlight:Thus, our best students are really good at one aspect of critical thinking­—being critical.
Highlight:The confident refusal to be affected by those with whom we disagree seems to have infected much of our cultural life: from politics to the press, from siloed academic programs (no matter how multidisciplinary) to warring public intellectuals
Highlight:help students cultivate the willingness and ability to learn from material they might otherwise reject or ignore. This material will often surprise students and sometimes upset them. Students seem to have learned that teaching-evaluation committees take seriously the criticism that ""the professor, or the material, made me uncomfortable."" This complaint is so toxic because being made uncomfortable may be a necessary component of an education in the humanities. Creating a humanistic culture that values the desire to learn from unexpected and uncomfortable sources as much as it values the critical faculties would be an important contribution to our academic and civic life.
Highlight:The philosopher Robert Pippin has recently made a similar point, and has described how evolutionary biology and psychology have moved into this terrain, explaining moral values as the product of the same dynamic that gives rise to the taste for sweets. Pippin argues, on the contrary, that ""the practical autonomy of the normative is the proper terrain of the humanities,"" and he has an easy task of showing how the pseudoscientific evolutionary ""explanation"" of our moral choices is a pretty flimsy ""just-so"" story.
Highlight:When we learn to read or look or listen intensively, we are not just becoming adept at exposing falsehood or at uncovering yet more examples of the duplicities of culture and society. We are partially overcoming our own blindness by trying to understand something from another's artistic, philosophical, or historical point of view
Highlight:It is my hope that humanists will continue offering criticism, making connections, and finding ways to acknowledge practices that seem at first opaque or even invisible. In supporting a transition from critical thinking to practical exploration, I am echoing a comment made by my undergraduate philosophy teacher Louis Mink, and echoed by my graduate mentor, Richard Rorty. Years before Dick Rorty deconstructed the idea of the ""philosopher as referee,"" Louis Mink suggested that critics ""exchange the judge's wig for the guide's cap."" I think we may say the same for humanists, who can, in his words, ""show us details and patterns and relations which we would not have seen or heard for ourselves.""

Highlight:All three pathways converge
at an enzyme activity called C3 convertase
Highlight:There has been a great
deal of debate about the evolutionary history of the
complement pathways.
Highlight:It is thought that much of the vertebrate complement system
arose from duplication of genes encoding C3/C4/C5, Bf/C2,
C1s/C1r/MASP-1/MASP-2, and C6/C7/C8/C9 molecules<sup><a href=""#nine"">9</a></sup>
Highlight:It appears then that the
vertebrate pathways could not have evolved in a Darwinian
fashion from earlier lectin pathways, because they are
dependent upon the activity of C3 convertase
Highlight:It appears then that the
vertebrate pathways could not have evolved in a Darwinian
fashion from earlier lectin pathways, because they are
dependent upon the activity of C3 convertase
Highlight:C2b is also known as C3 convertase,
Sticky notes:Differs from SC video series which indicates that C4b2a is C3
Convertase

Highlight:So while
vertebrate classical pathways are irreducibly complex in
that the entire pathway is dependent upon at least one
enzyme, it is clear that evolutionarily older organisms
possess a functional pathway even in the absence of that
enzyme.
Highlight:""Darwinian
evolution can easily produce irreducible complexity: all
that's required is that parts that were once just favorable
become, because of later changes, essential.""<sup><a href=""#nineteen"">19</a></sup>

They are especially appropriate to study rare exposures or exposures for which randomization is not possible for practical or ethical reasons. Prospective and retrospective cohort studies have higher accuracy and higher efficiency as their respective main advantages. In addition to possible confounding by indication, cohort studies may suffer from selection bias. Confounding and bias should be prevented whenever possible, but still can exert unknown effects in unknown directions. If one is aware of this, cohort studies can form a potent study design in nephrology producing, in general, highly generalizable results.

<blockquote><p>The press in our free country is reliable and useful not because of its good character but because of its great diversity. As long as there are many owners, each pursuing his own brand of truth, we the people have the opportunity to arrive at the truth and to dwell in the light. The multiplicity of ownership is crucial. It’s only when there are a few owners, or, as in a government-controlled press, one owner, that the truth becomes elusive and the light fails. For a citizen in our free society, it is an enormous privilege and a wonderful protection to have access to hundreds of periodicals, each peddling its own belief. There is safety in numbers: the papers expose each other’s follies and peccadillos, correct each other’s mistakes, and cancel out each other’s biases. The reader is free to range around in the whole editorial bouillabaisse and explore it for the one clam that matters—the truth.</p></blockquote>
